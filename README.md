# TranslationExporter
This is simple java tool, that will help you to export your strings.xml resources into the csv file, so you can pass it to some non-technical person to translate it using Google Sheets, Excel etc...

After the translation is done, simply export from Sheets to csv and the tool will make strings.xml out of it.

#Usage
So far the easiest way to use it is clone the repo and run it using InteliJ IDE.

#Plans
Would be nice to have UI for that, so IDE is no longer necessary
